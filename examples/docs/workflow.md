# Development Workflow

When you are given a task, always do the following:
1. Read the /docs/README.md file to understand the context of the project.
2. Understand the type of task you are being given, is it a UI design task, a coding task, a technical design/planning task or something else.
3. Once you have identified the type of task, read the documents from the /docs folder that specifically relate to the task. 
4. Based on your understanding from the documents and the task being given, ask any clarifying questions.
5. Before proceeding to do any implementation work, respond back to the user explaining your understanding of the task to make sure you and the user are aligned.
