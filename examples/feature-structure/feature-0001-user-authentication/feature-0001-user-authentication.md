# Feature: User Authentication

**Feature ID:** feature-0001  
**Created:** 2024-01-15  
**Branch:** feature/user-authentication  
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview
Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and manage their sessions. The system will use JWT tokens for stateless authentication and include features like password reset and session management.

## Goals
- Enable users to create accounts and securely login
- Implement stateless authentication using JWT tokens
- Provide password reset functionality via email
- Support session management across devices

## Key Requirements
1. **User Registration**
   - Email and password registration
   - Email verification required
   - Password strength requirements
   - Duplicate email prevention

2. **User Login**
   - Email/password authentication
   - JWT token generation (access + refresh tokens)
   - Remember me functionality
   - Failed login attempt tracking

3. **Session Management**
   - 15-minute access tokens
   - 7-day refresh tokens
   - Token refresh endpoint
   - Logout functionality (token revocation)
   - Multi-device session tracking

4. **Password Management**
   - Forgot password flow via email
   - Password reset with secure tokens
   - Password change for logged-in users
   - Password history to prevent reuse

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Social login (OAuth) - planned for phase 2
- Two-factor authentication - separate feature
- SSO integration - enterprise feature later

## Technical Approach
- Use JWT for stateless authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Redis for token blacklisting
- Email service for notifications
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

## Implementation Tasks

### 1.0 Setup and Planning
- [x] Create feature branch
- [x] Set up auth module structure
- [x] Design database schema
- [ ] Set up Redis for token management

### 2.0 Core Implementation
- [x] User model and repository
- [x] Password hashing utilities
- [x] JWT token generation
- [ ] JWT token validation middleware
- [ ] Refresh token rotation logic

### 3.0 Registration Flow
- [x] Registration endpoint
- [x] Email validation
- [ ] Email verification service
- [ ] Verification endpoint

### 4.0 Login Flow
- [x] Login endpoint
- [x] Token generation
- [ ] Failed attempt tracking
- [ ] Remember me functionality

### 5.0 Session Management
- [ ] Token refresh endpoint
- [ ] Logout endpoint
- [ ] Token revocation
- [ ] Multi-device session list

### 6.0 Password Management
- [ ] Forgot password endpoint
- [ ] Password reset email
- [ ] Reset token validation
- [ ] Change password endpoint

### 7.0 Testing
- [x] Unit tests for auth utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for full flows
- [ ] Security testing

### 8.0 Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Security guidelines
- [ ] Migration guide
- [ ] Update README

## Success Criteria
- [x] Users can register with email/password
- [x] Users can login and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] Tokens properly expire and can be refreshed
- [ ] Password reset flow works end-to-end
- [ ] All endpoints have proper error handling
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage on auth module

## Dependencies
- Email service must be configured
- Redis must be available for token storage
- Database migrations must be run

## Notes
- Decided to use JWT over sessions for better scalability
- Refresh tokens will use rotation for enhanced security
- Rate limiting critical on all auth endpoints
