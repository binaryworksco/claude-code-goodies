# Decision Log: User Authentication

## Decisions

### 2024-01-15 - Authentication Method: JWT vs Sessions
**Context**: Need to decide between traditional server-side sessions and JWT tokens for authentication
**Options Considered**:
1. Server-side sessions with Redis - Simple, revocable, but requires session storage
2. JWT with short-lived access tokens - Stateless, scalable, but harder to revoke
3. JWT with refresh token rotation - Best of both worlds, secure and scalable

**Decision**: Use JWT with refresh token rotation
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with microservices architecture plans
- Refresh tokens allow revocation when stored in DB
- Access tokens stay stateless and short-lived (15 min)
- Industry best practice for modern APIs

**Impact**: 
- Need to implement token refresh endpoint
- Must store refresh tokens in database
- Requires careful handling of token rotation

### 2024-01-15 - Password Hashing Algorithm
**Context**: Choose secure password hashing algorithm
**Options Considered**:
1. bcrypt - Battle-tested, widely supported, adaptive cost
2. Argon2 - Newer, winner of password hashing competition
3. scrypt - Good but less library support

**Decision**: Use bcrypt with cost factor 12
**Rationale**:
- Mature and well-tested in production
- Excellent library support in our tech stack
- Cost factor 12 provides good security vs performance balance
- Can increase cost factor in future if needed

**Impact**: 
- 200-300ms hashing time per password
- Need to handle async hashing in auth flow

### 2024-01-15 - Email Verification Requirement
**Context**: Should email verification be required or optional?
**Options Considered**:
1. Optional - Better user experience, faster onboarding
2. Required before login - Most secure, ensures valid emails
3. Required within grace period - Balance of UX and security

**Decision**: Required before first login
**Rationale**:
- Prevents spam accounts
- Ensures we can reach users for password reset
- Industry standard for SaaS applications
- GDPR compliance for user communications

**Impact**:
- Need email service integration immediately
- Must handle verification email resending
- Add clear messaging about verification requirement

### 2024-01-15 - Refresh Token Storage
**Context**: Where to store refresh tokens for revocation
**Options Considered**:
1. Redis only - Fast but tokens lost on restart
2. Database only - Persistent but potentially slower
3. Database with Redis cache - Complex but performant

**Decision**: Database only (PostgreSQL)
**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation initially
- Refresh token lookups less frequent than access tokens
- Can add Redis cache later if performance requires
- Ensures tokens survive system restarts

**Impact**:
- Need refresh_tokens table with indexes
- Must handle token cleanup (expired tokens)
- Consider partitioning table if volume grows

### 2024-01-15 - Token Expiration Times
**Context**: Determine appropriate token lifetimes
**Options Considered**:
1. Access: 5min, Refresh: 1day - Very secure but poor UX
2. Access: 1hour, Refresh: 30days - Common but may be too long
3. Access: 15min, Refresh: 7days - Balanced approach

**Decision**: Access tokens 15 minutes, Refresh tokens 7 days
**Rationale**:
- 15 minutes limits exposure of compromised access tokens
- 7 days requires weekly re-authentication (good security practice)
- Matches industry recommendations for sensitive data
- Can adjust based on user feedback

**Impact**:
- Frontend must handle token refresh seamlessly
- Need good error handling for expired tokens
- Consider "remember me" for 30-day refresh tokens

### Future Decisions Needed
- Rate limiting strategy (per IP vs per user)
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout policy after failed attempts
- Multi-factor authentication approach (Phase 2)
