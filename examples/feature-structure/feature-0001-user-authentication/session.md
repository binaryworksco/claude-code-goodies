# Session: User Authentication

## Feature: User Authentication (feature-0001)
- Branch: feature/user-authentication
- Created: 2024-01-15 09:00
- Last Updated: 2024-01-15 14:30
- Status: In Progress

## Current Focus
Implementing JWT refresh token endpoint with proper rotation logic

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create feature branch
- [x] Set up auth module structure  
- [x] Design database schema
- [x] User model and repository
- [x] Password hashing utilities
- [x] JWT token generation
- [x] Registration endpoint
- [x] Email validation
- [x] Login endpoint
- [x] Token generation
- [x] Unit tests for auth utilities

## Key Decisions
- 2024-01-15: Use JWT with refresh token rotation instead of sliding sessions for better security
- 2024-01-15: Store refresh tokens in database for revocation capability
- 2024-01-15: Use bcrypt with cost factor 12 for password hashing
- 2024-01-15: Implement email verification as required step (not optional)

## Blockers/Questions
- Need to confirm email service configuration with DevOps team
- Should we implement password complexity rules beyond minimum length?

## Next Steps
- Complete JWT token validation middleware
- Implement refresh token rotation logic
- Add integration tests for login/registration flow
- Set up Redis for token blacklisting

## Notes
- Remember to add rate limiting before deploying to staging
- Consider adding metrics for failed login attempts
- Need to document the token refresh flow clearly
