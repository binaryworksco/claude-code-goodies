# Context Search

## Purpose
This command searches across all files in the .working directory to find relevant context for a specific topic or keyword. It helps you quickly locate information without loading entire files, supporting the "just enough context" principle.

## Usage
To use this command, provide the topic or keyword you want to search for:
```
/context <topic>
```

## Instructions

### 1. Parse Search Query
Extract the search topic from the user's input. If no topic is provided, ask the user what they want to search for.

### 2. Search Strategy
Perform a comprehensive search across the .working directory:
- Search in all markdown files (.md)
- Look for the topic in file contents, not just filenames
- Use case-insensitive matching
- Include partial matches

### 3. Present Results
Display search results in a structured format:
- Group results by file
- Show relevant snippets (2-3 lines of context around matches)
- Include line numbers for easy reference
- Limit to top 10 most relevant results

### 4. Smart Suggestions
Based on the search results:
- Suggest which specific files to read for more detail
- Identify if the topic relates to a specific PRD, issue, or task
- Recommend related searches if the initial search yields few results
