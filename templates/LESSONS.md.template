# Lessons Learned

This document captures important learnings, patterns, and gotchas discovered while working on this project. It helps future development sessions avoid repeated mistakes and leverage proven solutions.

## Effective Patterns

### Code Patterns That Work Well
<!-- Add patterns that have proven successful -->

#### Example: Error Handling Pattern
**Context**: Consistent error handling across the application
**Pattern**: 
```javascript
try {
  const result = await someOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error, context });
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```
**Why it works**: Provides consistent structure, always logs errors with context

### Architecture Decisions That Paid Off
<!-- Document architectural choices that worked well -->

---

### Testing Strategies That Work
<!-- Effective testing approaches -->

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Things That Don't Work
<!-- Document approaches that seemed good but caused problems -->

#### Example: Avoid Global State in Tests
**What we tried**: Using global test data
**Problem**: Tests became interdependent and flaky
**Solution**: Each test creates its own data in `beforeEach`

## Template Usage

When adding new lessons:
1. Add date if the lesson is time-sensitive
2. Include context about why the lesson was learned
3. Provide concrete examples
4. Link to relevant PRs or issues if applicable

Example entry:
```markdown
### 2024-01-15: Database Connection Pool Issues
**Context**: Production app was running out of connections
**Problem**: Default pool size of 10 was too small for our load
**Solution**: Increased pool size to 50, added monitoring
**PR**: #123
**Lesson**: Always monitor connection pool usage in production
```
