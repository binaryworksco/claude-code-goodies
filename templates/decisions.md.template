## Decisions

### Example: 2024-01-15 - Authentication Method
**Context**: Need to decide between JWT tokens and session-based auth
**Options Considered**:
1. JWT tokens - Stateless, scalable, but requires token refresh logic
2. Server sessions - Simpler, but requires session storage
3. OAuth only - Delegates auth but limits control

**Decision**: Use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
**Rationale**: Better fits our microservices architecture and mobile app needs
**Impact**: Need to implement token refresh endpoint and secure storage
